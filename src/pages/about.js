      <p>
        BECS instant messaging (IM) technology is a type of online chat allowing
        real-time text transmission over the Internet or another computer
        network. Messages are typically transmitted between two or more parties,
        when each user inputs text and triggers a transmission to the
        recipient(s), who are all connected on a common network. It differs from
        email in that conversations over instant messaging happen in real-time
        (hence "instant"). Most modern IM applications (sometimes called "social
        messengers", "messaging apps" or "chat apps") use push technology and
        also add other features such as emojis (or graphical smileys), file
        transfer, chatbots, Voice over IP, or video chat capabilities.

        BECS Instant messaging systems tend to facilitate connections between
        specified known users (often using a contact list also known as a "buddy
        list" or "friend list"), and can be standalone applications or
        integrated into e.g. a wider social media platform, or a website where
        it can for instance be used for conversational commerce. IM can also
        consist of conversations in "chat rooms". Depending on the IM protocol,
        the technical architecture can be peer-to-peer (direct point-to-point
        transmission) or clientâ€“server (an IM service center retransmits
        messages from the sender to the communication device). It is usually
        distinguished from text messaging which is typically simpler and
        normally uses cellular phone networks.
